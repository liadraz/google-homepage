// First mini-project -
Deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. 

The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. 

* Use the browser's development tools.
* Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out 

Make sure you know how to do these before starting:
- Two ways to move a div around on the page
- Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
- Identify the background color of an existing webpage
- Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
- Center an element horizontally
- Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
- Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at - specific elements on the page
- Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
